# Zig package for rosidl and rosidl_typesupport

This provides a zig package for the ROS2 rosidl project, as well as some zig helpers to streamline interface generation within the zig build system.
This currently targets zig 0.13 and ROS Jazzy.

It also includes the rosidl_typesupport repo since they also use the same style of generators and depend largely on rosidl.
